Alice

Alice is an app that manages shortcuts on a per project basis.

Shortcuts can be to almost anything (e.g. documents, folders, applications, etc.) and can be configured to provide command line arguments and set environment variables.

Projects may have several 'profiles' which can alter how the shortcuts are resolved. This is useful, for example, when launching apps that have both debug and release builds.
